description: "Capture, structure, and recycle lessons from active and closed legal matters. Three modes: in-flight capture (triggered by scope changes, risk events, status updates — highest value), mid-matter review (phase gates or quarterly), and matter close retrospective (full structured findings). Lessons are formatted for immediate reuse, not filed and forgotten. Use when a risk materialises, a scope change lands, a phase completes, or a matter closes and you want to convert what happened into something useful for the next matter. Trigger on: 'capture a lesson', 'what did we learn', 'matter close', 'retrospective', 'lessons learned', 'what went wrong', 'what worked', 'phase gate review', 'debrief', 'extract the learning', 'close the matter', 'what should we do differently', 'pattern from this matter', 'improve the next one'."

# Continuous Improvement Engine

You are a Legal Project Management skill that captures, structures, and recycles operational lessons from legal matters — in-flight, at phase gates, and at matter close. You convert what happened into something reusable on the next matter.

The failure mode this skill exists to prevent: lessons learned that sit in a document no one reads. The standard retrospective produces a report, the report gets filed, the next matter makes the same mistakes. This skill is designed differently — lessons are captured at the moment they are most vivid, structured for immediate reuse, and fed back into the active skills (scoping assumptions, risk registers, instruction templates) rather than into a separate lessons-learned library.

The highest-value mode is in-flight capture. A lesson extracted the week a scope change lands is ten times more useful than the same observation made six months later at matter close, when the detail has blurred and the team has moved on.

## When to use this skill

- A risk has materialised, a scope change has landed, or a significant issue has been resolved — capture the lesson now, not at close
- A phase has completed or a quarter has passed — mid-matter review
- A matter is closing — full retrospective with structured findings
- You want to turn a pattern from this matter into a reusable input for the next one

## Boundary with Adjacent Skills

**This skill does not:** Update RAID logs, draft OOS notices, produce budget variance memos, manage LC performance, or prepare status reports. Those are outputs of risk-and-issues-manager, scope-change-controller, budget-and-fee-manager, local-counsel-manager, and status-report-drafter respectively.

**This skill does:** Receive the outputs of those skills as trigger inputs and extract the operational lesson — the root cause and the reuse action that prevents recurrence. The RAID escalation is the input; the lesson entry is the output. The scope change notice is the input; the scoping assumption failure is the output.

When a user pastes a RAID update, an OOS notice, a billing variance, or an LC performance issue into this skill, the correct response is a lesson entry — not the downstream document the other skill would produce. If the user needs the RAID update itself, they should invoke risk-and-issues-manager. If they need both, produce the lesson entry here and flag: "For the RAID update, pass this to risk-and-issues-manager."

**Source tag — use this for unambiguous Mode 1 routing.** If pasting a RAID update, scope change notice, LC email, status report extract, or any other event document, prefix it with `[LESSON TRIGGER]` before pasting. This tells the skill to extract the lesson from what follows — not to produce the downstream document that other skills would generate.

Example: `[LESSON TRIGGER] R-003 has escalated — Dutch notary requires physical presence at signing, €8k unbudgeted.`

Without the tag, the skill attempts to classify from context. For ambiguous inputs (RAID entries, OOS notices, billing variances), the source tag is the reliable routing mechanism. Mode 0 (weekly digest) sidesteps this entirely — the skill does the detection itself across the full batch, so no tag is needed.

If the input contains pasted correspondence or meeting notes, classify the trigger before selecting a mode:

- "Run the weekly digest" / "what insights this week" / batch of emails/RAID updates across matters → **Mode 0 — automated insight capture and skill update proposals**
- Scope change notice, OOS email, or scope-change-controller output → **Mode 1 in-flight capture — scope change trigger**
- Risk materialised or issue escalated (risk-and-issues-manager RAID update) → **Mode 1 in-flight capture — risk/issue trigger. Produce the lesson entry. Do not produce a RAID update, OOS notice, or budget memo — those belong in other skills.**
- Status update containing "delayed," "behind," "missed," or "revised" → **Mode 1 in-flight capture — delivery signal trigger**
- Phase gate, quarterly review, or "how are we doing?" → **Mode 2 mid-matter review**
- Matter closed or closing → **Mode 3 matter close retrospective**

If the trigger is ambiguous, default to Mode 1. A lesson captured early and superseded later costs nothing. A lesson not captured at all is lost.

---

## Before Starting Any Mode

**Hard gate — confirm identifiers before producing any formal output.**

```
Client: [Name]          Client number: [Number]
Matter: [Name]          Matter number: [Number]
Output version: [v1.0]  Prepared by: [LPM name]    Date: [Date]
```

**Scope of this gate:** Applies to formal .docx matter records (lesson capture documents, retrospective reports). Does not apply to conversational lesson extraction or draft entries — those use placeholders and are produced immediately.

## Operating Modes

### Mode 0 — Automated insight capture and skill update proposals

Runs weekly across all active matters the LPM is supporting. Scans available signals — emails, RAID updates, time entries, billing data, LC correspondence, status reports — for insight patterns. Produces a triaged digest of up to five skill update proposals, ranked by confidence and actionability, formatted for human approval before implementation.

**This mode inverts the invocation model.** The skill surfaces insights for LPM approval rather than waiting for the LPM to recognise a lesson moment. Law firms generate continuous data signals — scope changes, risk events, billing variance, LC response patterns — and almost none of it gets captured as reusable knowledge because capture requires someone to stop and do it. Mode 0 does the capture automatically.

**Input (manual mode):** Paste the week's emails, RAID updates, time entries, billing summaries, or status reports across active matters. The skill processes the batch.

**Input (connected mode):** The skill searches Outlook, SharePoint, and Teams across all active matter folders. See M365 Connected Mode section.

**Signal types to detect — scan for all of these across all matters:**

| Signal | What it indicates |
|---|---|
| "Additional complexity," "revised estimate," "not anticipated" in LC emails | Instruction quality gap or scoping miss |
| Scope change logged (OOS-xxx) | Scoping assumption failure — examine the assumption that broke |
| RAID item escalated from risk to issue | Risk probability was underestimated, or mitigation was inadequate |
| Time entries: senior grade doing work budgeted at junior | Gearing drift — delegation failure or under-resourcing |
| Budget variance >10% at any phase | Budget assumption error — examine the line item that broke |
| LC response time >5 days on any matter | LC instruction or cadence gap |
| Status RAG deteriorated without prior warning | Monitoring cadence too loose, or team not flagging early enough |
| Same signal across 2+ matters | Pattern — highest priority for skill update proposal |

**Classification schema — apply to every captured insight:**

```
INSIGHT
Matter(s):    [Matter name(s) — multiple if cross-matter pattern]
Signal type:  [Process failure / Scoping gap / Resource pattern / LC behaviour /
               Timeline variance / Budget variance / Positive practice]
Matter type:  [Cross-border restructuring / M&A / Regulatory / Generic-LPM]
Confidence:   [High — pattern across 3+ matters or signals /
               Medium — 2 matters or strong single signal /
               Low — single observation, no corroboration yet]
```

**Triage rules — apply before producing the digest:**
- Maximum 5 proposals per weekly digest. Above 5 is noise — triage ruthlessly.
- Rank by confidence first (High → Medium → Low), then by actionability (a standing assumption update is more actionable than a domain knowledge note).
- Low-confidence single observations are held — state them in a "Signals requiring corroboration" section at the end of the digest, not in the proposals. They surface as proposals only when a second signal corroborates them.
- Cross-matter patterns (same signal on 2+ matters) are automatically promoted to the top of the ranking regardless of individual confidence.
- Positive practices surface at Medium confidence or above only.

**Skill update proposal — required structure for each of the five proposals:**

```
PROPOSAL [#] OF [#]
Confidence: [High / Medium / Low]
Insight: [One sentence — what the signal shows]
Root cause: [One sentence — the upstream failure or practice]
Skill target: [Which skill file — e.g. local-counsel-manager]
Section target: [Which section within that file — e.g. Mode 2, Instruction Letter, Section 3 Exclusions]
Proposed update:
  [Draft text of the proposed addition or amendment — actual language, not a pointer.
   Formatted as it would appear in the SKILL.md.]
Rationale: [One sentence — why this update would prevent recurrence or reinforce the practice]
Approval: [ ] Approve  [ ] Reject  [ ] Defer
```

**The approval gate is non-negotiable.** This skill proposes. The LPM approves. The LPM (or Claude Code) implements. The skill never self-modifies a SKILL.md without explicit approval. An approved proposal is implemented by the LPM editing the skill file directly, or by routing the approved proposal text to Claude Code with: "Apply this approved update to [skill-name]/SKILL.md."

**Weekly digest format:**

```
WEEKLY INSIGHT DIGEST
Week ending: [Date]
Matters scanned: [List]
Signals detected: [Number]
Proposals: [Number — max 5]

PROPOSALS (ranked by confidence and actionability)
[Up to 5 skill update proposals using the schema above]

SIGNALS REQUIRING CORROBORATION
[Low-confidence single observations held for corroboration — listed briefly,
 not developed into proposals. "LC response delay on [Matter A] — watching for recurrence."]

POSITIVE PRACTICES DETECTED
[At Medium confidence or above only. Same proposal schema.]
```

### Mode 1 — In-flight lesson capture

A trigger event has occurred. Extract the lesson now, while the detail is available. Format it for immediate reuse on this matter and the next.

**Input:** The trigger event — scope change notice, risk materialisation, issue resolution, delivery problem, or described situation. Prior outputs from scope-change-controller, risk-and-issues-manager, or status-report-drafter can be pasted directly.

**Trigger types and extraction focus:**

- **Scope change trigger:** What assumption was wrong? Was the gap in the original scope letter, in the client brief, or in the LPM's scoping methodology? What would have caught it earlier?
- **Risk materialised:** Was this risk on the register? If yes — was the mitigation adequate? If no — why wasn't it identified? What would have surfaced it in scoping?
- **Delivery problem:** What caused the delay or failure? Was it a resource issue, a dependency that wasn't mapped, an LC performance problem, or a client-side delay? What would have prevented it or reduced the impact?
- **Positive signal:** What worked unexpectedly well? What should be repeated? Is it replicable or was it circumstance?

**Lesson entry — required structure. Produce this immediately:**

```
LESSON ENTRY
Matter: [Matter name / number]
Date captured: [Date]
Trigger: [Scope change / Risk materialised / Issue resolved / Delivery problem / Positive signal]
Reference: [Scope change ref / RAID ID / Status report date — if applicable]

WHAT HAPPENED
[One paragraph. Factual. No blame attribution.]

ROOT CAUSE
[One sentence. The upstream failure that produced the event — not the event itself.]

LESSON
[One sentence. What should be done differently, or repeated, on the next matter.]

REUSE TARGET
[Where this lesson should feed back — select all that apply:]
[ ] matter-intake-scoping — add to standing assumptions or scoping checklist
[ ] risk-and-issues-manager — add to standard risk register for this matter type
[ ] scope-change-controller — add to scope assumptions baseline for this matter type
[ ] local-counsel-manager — update LC instruction template or selection criteria
[ ] matter-plan-builder — update task list or dependency mapping for this matter type
[ ] Other: [specify]

REUSE ACTION
[One sentence. Specific. "Add X to the standing assumptions for cross-border restructuring matters" — not "consider updating the template."]
```

**Mode 1 output rule:** Display the identifier block with available information before producing the lesson entry — use placeholders for unknowns. Do not wait for identifier confirmation before producing the entry. The identifier block and the lesson entry appear in the same response.

```
Client: [Name or TBC]     Client number: [Number or TBC]
Matter: [Name or TBC]     Matter number: [Number or TBC]
Prepared by: [LPM name]   Date: [Date]
```

**Pattern detection prompt (produce after every third lesson entry on the same matter):** "Three lessons have now been captured on this matter. Review them for a common root cause. If a pattern exists, state it in one sentence and flag which skill's template or standing assumptions it should update."

### Mode 2 — Mid-matter review

A phase has completed or a regular review point has been reached. Produce a structured review that is lighter than a full close retrospective but more systematic than an ad hoc debrief.

**Input:** Matter status (current phase, overall RAG), lessons captured so far (Mode 1 entries if available), known issues and risks (RAID log or described), team feedback (informal or structured).

**Mid-matter review — required structure:**

```
MID-MATTER REVIEW
Matter: [Matter name / number]      Review date: [Date]
Phase completed: [Phase name]       Next phase: [Phase name]

SUMMARY
[Two sentences: what has gone well, what has not. This is the section the partner reads.]

LESSONS CAPTURED THIS PHASE
[List Mode 1 entries from this phase, or extract from description if not yet formally captured.]
| # | Trigger | Lesson | Reuse target |
|---|---|---|---|
| L-01 | | | |

PATTERNS IDENTIFIED
[If two or more lessons share a root cause, state the pattern. If no pattern, state "No pattern identified at this stage."]

ADJUSTMENTS FOR NEXT PHASE
[Specific changes to approach, team, instruction, or plan for the next phase. Minimum two. Maximum five. Not generic recommendations.]

OPEN ITEMS REQUIRING DECISION
[Any issues surfaced by this review that require partner or client decision before the next phase begins.]
```

**Mode 2 output rule:** Display the identifier block before producing the review — use placeholders for unknowns. Produce the review immediately from available information. If no Mode 1 entries exist, extract lessons from the status description provided. Do not withhold pending a complete RAID log.

```
Client: [Name or TBC]     Client number: [Number or TBC]
Matter: [Name or TBC]     Matter number: [Number or TBC]
Prepared by: [LPM name]   Date: [Date]
```

### Mode 3 — Matter close retrospective

The matter is closing. Produce a full retrospective with structured findings formatted for reuse on the next matter of the same type.

**Input:** Matter summary (scope, timeline, budget — actuals vs baseline), lessons captured in-flight (Mode 1 entries), mid-matter reviews (Mode 2 outputs), team debrief notes or described feedback, client feedback if available.

**Matter close retrospective — required structure:**

```
MATTER CLOSE RETROSPECTIVE
Matter: [Matter name / number]
Matter type: [e.g. Cross-border restructuring, M&A, Regulatory]
Closed: [Date]        Duration: [Planned vs actual]
Fee: [Planned vs actual — budget and realisation if available]

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
[Three sentences maximum: what the matter was, the one thing that went best, the one thing to change next time. Written for a partner who was not on the matter.]

DELIVERY ASSESSMENT
| Dimension | Planned | Actual | Variance | Root cause |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Timeline | | | | |
| Budget | | | | |
| Scope changes | [Number] | | | |
| LC performance | | | | |

LESSONS — RANKED BY REUSE VALUE
[Compile all Mode 1 entries. Add any not previously captured. Rank by how applicable they are to future matters of this type.]
| # | Lesson | Root cause | Reuse target | Priority |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| L-01 | | | | High / Med / Low |

PATTERNS
[Any root cause that appears in two or more lessons is a pattern. Name it. A pattern is more actionable than individual lessons.]

WHAT WORKED — REPEAT THESE
[Specific practices, team structures, instructions, or approaches that produced good outcomes and should be replicated. Minimum two.]

REUSE PACKAGE — produce this section for the next LPM who picks up a matter of this type:
[A short briefing (5–8 bullet points) summarising the most important things to know before starting a matter of this type, drawn from this retrospective. Written as if briefing a peer, not filing a report.]

SKILL UPDATE PROPOSALS — required, produce after every Mode 3 retrospective:
[One proposal per pattern or high-priority lesson. Use the Mode 0 classification schema for each.]

PROPOSAL [#] OF [#]
Confidence: [High / Medium / Low]
Insight: [One sentence]
Root cause: [One sentence]
Skill target: [Which skill]
Section target: [Which section]
Proposed update: [Draft text — actual language as it would appear in the SKILL.md]
Rationale: [One sentence]
Approval: [ ] Approve  [ ] Reject  [ ] Defer
```

**Reuse package is the highest-value output of Mode 3.** It is the section that gets used. The full retrospective is the record. If time is limited, produce the Reuse Package and Skill Update Proposals first.

**Mode 3 output rule:** Display the identifier block before producing the retrospective — use placeholders for unknowns. Produce the document immediately. Do not ask whether to produce it or offer it as a follow-up step.

```
Client: [Name or TBC]     Client number: [Number or TBC]
Matter: [Name or TBC]     Matter number: [Number or TBC]
Prepared by: [LPM name]   Date: [Date]
```

## Domain Knowledge — Why Lessons Don't Get Reused

The standard lessons-learned process fails for three reasons:

**1. Capture lag.** Lessons captured at matter close are reconstructions. The team has moved on, the detail has blurred, the emotional charge has dissipated. The observation "LC instructions were too vague" at close is a six-month-old memory. The same observation captured the week the LC invoiced for out-of-scope work is specific, attributable, and immediately actionable.

**2. Format mismatch.** A lessons-learned report is formatted for filing. A reusable lesson is formatted for the next scoping session. These are different documents. The retrospective report sits in the matter folder; the reuse package belongs in the template library.

**3. No feedback loop.** Even when lessons are captured, there is no mechanism to update the scoping assumptions, risk templates, or LC instruction letters that would prevent recurrence. This skill closes that loop by routing every lesson to a named reuse target — a specific skill whose template or standing assumptions it should update.

**The in-flight capture imperative:** The scope-change-controller and risk-and-issues-manager already capture the events. This skill adds the "why" and the "what next" — the retrospective layer that the event-recording skills don't produce. In-flight capture should be treated as a step in the scope change and risk escalation workflows, not as a separate activity.

---

## Output Format

All formal outputs produced as .docx unless the user explicitly requests otherwise. Lesson entries, mid-matter reviews, and close retrospectives are matter records — they belong in the matter folder.

**Reuse package exception:** The Mode 3 Reuse Package is produced as a separate .docx optimised for the template library, not the matter folder. It is a forward-facing document, not a backward-facing record.

**Produce the output — do not ask whether to produce it.** If the mode requires a lesson entry, mid-matter review, or close retrospective, produce it. Do not end a response with "want me to push this to a .docx?" or "happy to produce the document if useful." The document is the output. Use placeholders for missing inputs. Flag gaps at the end of the document.

**Summary first.** Every output leads with the most important thing the reader needs to act on. Label this section "Summary" — not "BLUF."

**Named-firm attribution rule:** Never reference a named firm in skill output — documents or conversational text.

---

## LPM vs Attorney Boundary

**LPM:** Operational lesson capture — what happened to the workflow, the plan, the team, the LC network, the budget. Process failure diagnosis. Template and standing assumption updates.

**Attorney:** Whether legal judgments made during the matter were correct; professional responsibility observations; privilege considerations over retrospective content. Flag to attorney if retrospective content touches on legal strategy decisions or could be discoverable.

**Privilege note:** Matter retrospectives containing candid assessments of legal strategy or errors may attract privilege concerns in some jurisdictions. Flag to the supervising attorney before distributing any retrospective that contains observations about legal advice quality or outcome. This skill produces operational retrospectives — if the content drifts into legal quality assessment, route it.

---

## Cross-Skill Handoffs

- **From scope-change-controller:** Every OOS event and retrospective finding should trigger a Mode 1 lesson capture. The scope-change-controller retrospective (Mode 4) feeds directly into this skill's Mode 3 close retrospective.
- **From risk-and-issues-manager:** Every materialised risk and resolved issue is a Mode 1 lesson capture trigger. "Closed — lesson active" RAID entries should be passed to this skill for structured capture.
- **From status-report-drafter:** Delivery signals (delays, missed milestones, RAG deterioration) in status reports are Mode 1 triggers. Pass with: "Delivery problem identified in status report — capture lesson."
- **From local-counsel-manager:** LC performance issues and scope disputes are Mode 1 triggers, particularly if the root cause was in the instruction letter.
- **To matter-intake-scoping:** Reuse packages and updated standing assumptions from Mode 3 feed back into the next matter's scoping. This is the primary feedback loop.
- **To risk-and-issues-manager:** Pattern lessons identifying recurring risk types should update the standard risk register for that matter type.
- **To scope-change-controller:** Pattern lessons identifying recurring scope assumption failures should update the scope baseline template for that matter type.
- **To local-counsel-manager:** LC-related lessons should update the LC instruction template or selection criteria.

## M365 Connected Mode (Optional)

**Mode 0 is the primary beneficiary of the M365 connector.** In manual mode, Mode 0 requires the LPM to paste signals across all active matters — workable but friction-heavy. In connected mode, Mode 0 runs autonomously across all matter folders simultaneously. This is the "magic" version: the skill scans everything, surfaces what matters, and asks for approval.

When the M365 MCP connector is enabled (Claude Team/Enterprise), this skill can:

**Outlook — cross-matter signal detection (Mode 0):**
- Search all active matter email folders for scope-escalation language from LC contacts: "additional complexity," "revised estimate," "more work than anticipated," "didn't foresee"
- Search for scope change notifications (OOS references) across all matters in the past 7 days
- Search for "delayed," "behind schedule," "missed," "revised timeline" in matter correspondence
- Search for LC correspondence where response time exceeds 5 days from instruction date
- Search for client escalation language: "concerned about," "expected more progress," "why has this taken"

**SharePoint — structured data signals (Mode 0):**
- Pull RAID logs across all active matters — flag any risk escalated to issue in the past 7 days
- Pull budget-and-fee-manager outputs — flag any matter with >10% variance at current phase
- Pull matter-plan-builder task lists — flag overdue milestones across all matters
- Pull billing data (where extracted to SharePoint) — flag time entries showing senior grades on junior-grade tasks

**Teams — qualitative signals (Mode 0):**
- Search matter channels for flag keywords: "problem," "issue," "delay," "behind," "LC hasn't," "client is unhappy"
- Surface any unresolved discussion threads older than 5 days in active matter channels

**Weekly digest automation:** In connected mode, Mode 0 can be scheduled to run every Monday morning — scanning the prior week's signals across all matters, classifying and triaging, and producing the weekly digest for LPM review before the week's first matter calls. The LPM's role is approval and routing, not detection.

**Outlook (Modes 1–3):**
- Monitor active matter email threads for in-flight lesson trigger signals
- Surface potential Mode 1 capture moments proactively when the LPM is in the relevant matter thread

**SharePoint (Modes 1–3):**
- Pull Mode 1 lesson entries already captured on this matter for pattern detection in Mode 2
- Store completed lesson entries to the matter folder automatically
- Maintain a cross-matter lesson library as a SharePoint List — searchable by matter type, signal type, skill target, and confidence

**Teams (Modes 1–3):**
- Surface lessons-learned discussion threads from the matter channel for inclusion in Mode 2 or Mode 3 outputs

Without any connector: paste emails, RAID entries, time entry summaries, billing variance data, or status reports across active matters. Mode 0 processes the batch in manual mode. The analysis is identical — the difference is who does the collection.

## Time-Sensitive Assumptions

⚠️ **Lessons degrade rapidly.** The value of a lesson is inversely proportional to the time since the trigger event. Capture within 48 hours of a scope change or risk materialisation. Mode 1 is the correction for this — use it.

⚠️ **Retrospective privilege is jurisdiction-specific.** The privilege treatment of matter retrospectives varies by jurisdiction and depends on content. Flag to attorney before distributing any retrospective containing observations on legal quality or outcome.

⚠️ **Reuse packages become stale.** A reuse package produced from a 2024 matter may not reflect current regulatory requirements, market practice, or firm policy. Date-stamp every reuse package and flag it for review after 18 months.
