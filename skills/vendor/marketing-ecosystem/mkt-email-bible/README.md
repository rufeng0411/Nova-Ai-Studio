# Email Marketing Bible

**The AI email automation skill for Claude, ChatGPT, and any agent.**

Install it and your AI stops guessing about email. It audits your setup, builds your flows from a prompt, drafts copy in your voice (not slop), tells you why you are in spam, and runs your ESP through MCP, with a hard rule that nothing blasts without your say-so.

Built from 908 sources and the experience of running [SmartrMail](https://x.com/GTHartley) (email marketing SaaS, ~28,000 customers, 6 billion emails, acquired 2022). 17 chapters, 19 industry playbooks, 47 curated email designs. Free and open source.

## Why this exists

Most email marketing advice is surface-level. "Personalise your subject lines." "Segment your list." "A/B test everything." You have heard it. It does not help when you are staring at a 2% open rate, or when you have just handed an AI agent the keys to your sending account and it is about to industrialise your mistakes.

In 2026 the job changed. Agents now build the campaign, segment the audience, draft the copy, and stage the send. The marketer is the director, not the operator. That only works if the agent is working from real benchmarks and hard guardrails instead of vibes. This skill is that discipline layer: the patterns that repeat across industries, the mistakes that destroy deliverability, the anti-slop rules that keep AI output from reading like AI output, and the send-safety gates that keep one prompt from mailing the wrong thing to your whole list.

Every claim is backed by data. No theory, no filler.

## Install

```bash
git clone https://github.com/CosmoBlk/email-marketing-bible.git ~/.claude/skills/email-marketing-bible
```

One command. Your AI now has the full knowledge base. Works wherever you run skills (Claude Code, Claude Desktop, and agents that read the skill format).

## What the skill does

Once installed, your AI can:

| Task | What it does |
|------|-------------|
| **Run email automation** | Build welcome, cart, post-purchase, and win-back flows from a prompt, then review exits, timing, and copy before anything goes live |
| **Audit your setup** | Review flows, segments, deliverability, and compliance, and tell you exactly what is missing |
| **Draft and de-slop copy** | Write emails with proven frameworks (PAS, AIDA, BAB) and strip the AI tells before send |
| **Design anti-slop emails** | Own a colour, real imagery, live-text headlines, generated into inbox-safe MJML or React Email, dark-mode and mobile checked |
| **Drive your ESP from AI** | Operate Klaviyo, Resend, beehiiv, Mailchimp, Omnisend, or nitrosend through MCP and connectors, with pre-send safety gates |
| **Fix deliverability** | Diagnose inbox placement with a step-by-step triage covering authentication, reputation, content, and the AI-mediated inbox (Gemini summaries, open rate as noise) |
| **Pull industry benchmarks** | Open, click, conversion, and revenue-per-email figures for your specific vertical |
| **Compare platforms** | Honest comparison by list size, budget, and whether you want to run it from an agent, not affiliate commissions |
| **Review compliance** | GDPR, CAN-SPAM, CASL, CCPA, and the Australian Spam Act, as a decision gate before any send |
| **Write cold email** | Cold sequences with proper infrastructure separation, warming, and personalisation |

## How to use it

Install the skill, then talk to your AI like an email marketing consultant.

**Audit and build:**
```
"Audit my Klaviyo account for a DTC skincare brand doing $2M/year. I have a
welcome series, abandoned cart, and one weekly newsletter. What am I missing,
and build me whatever flow would earn the most first."
```

**Fix a problem:**
```
"My emails are landing in Gmail promotions and opens dropped from 22% to 14%
over three months. What is going on and how do I fix it?"
```

**De-slop:**
```
"Here is a draft welcome email. Make it sound like a person, not an AI, and
keep it on our brand voice."
```

**Design:**
```
"Design a launch email for a premium coffee brand. Own a colour, real product
photography, generate it as MJML so it renders everywhere."
```

The skill is structured in two parts: an operating manual (when the AI is acting: building, sending, diagnosing, designing) and a dense reference (benchmarks, frameworks, playbooks). Your AI reads the manual to operate and drops into the reference for facts.
